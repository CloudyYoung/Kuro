## This Repository
This repository stored a personal-modified version of this mod. It is only for me to study and practice, only for interest.   
All the copyright of art works belongs to Fynn.    
The name of this modified version of original mod in Steam Workshop is called "Urokay", it is "Kuro" in Pig Latin, since I don't want people get confused if there are two mods have the exact same name and meanwhile it can "sort of" keep its original name.


## What I Did
- Cleaned and re-organized the codes. The namings and logic were messy and confusing.
- Added more prefabs to this character, since the author does not update anymore, in the time of writing, and the character have too few prefab.
- Changed "Press Z to trasform" to "cast magic from his skull cane to transform". Friendly for people who use controllers, like me.
- Since the character always says "Your blood will be mine" when attacking, plus he is a vampire, it is good to actually have that ability. Therefore, when attacking, the character will regen certain percantage of health by every resolved damage he made.
- Balanced character values.
